# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project is deployed to Netlify which can be accessed [here](https://chimerical-longma-03626e.netlify.app/).

## Tech Stack and Libraries

- React JS, a front-end JavaScript library that uses a technique called "single-page application" or SPA. In SPA applications, only certain parts of the page are reloaded when you move to another page, not the entire page. This makes navigating between pages faster and provides a smoother user experience.
- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), preprocessor for CSS that adds additional features not available in regular CSS. This allows you to write less code that is cleaner, more modular, and easier to read.
- Bootstrap, open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
- React-Bootstrap, replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
- Git, open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Used to install all dependencies or devDependencies from a 'package.json' file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
